# Barter and crafting profits

Both profit routes enter [ProfitPage](../src/features/profit-pages/ProfitPage.tsx),
which loads [getProfitPageData](../src/server/queries/getProfitPageData.ts) and
renders [ProfitPageClient](../src/features/profit-pages/ProfitPageClient.tsx).
The query supplies both normalized recipe graphs, referenced item prices, and
compact trader/station presentation. Both graphs are required because acquisition
can cross between crafts and barters; either graph error blocks profit figures.
Stored acquisition views remain unpriced graphs; [data layer](data-layer.md) owns
runtime hydration and the price refresh pipeline.

## Calculation owners and rules

[recipes.ts](../src/features/profit-pages/utils/recipes.ts) builds a calculation
pass over the graphs using the shared [price-calculation engine](../src/lib/price-calculation/).
[optimizer.ts](../src/lib/price-calculation/optimizer.ts) chooses recursive
acquisition routes; [prices.ts](../src/lib/price-calculation/prices.ts) resolves
buy/sell inputs. Rows and item-modal recipe views consume completed evaluations
rather than selecting routes independently.

- Flea purchase and flea sale estimates share the robust minimum and stability
  model in [data layer](data-layer.md). Unstable mutable flea values remain usable
  rough estimates; instability alone never selects a lower trader value. Unavailable
  flea values remain null without reviving a catalog aggregate. Release
  reference pricing remains usable when mutable storage/points are absent or
  unusable. These estimates do not prove that any quantity can sell at that price.
- Sale value compares usable flea and best trader sale, explicitly naming the
  selected source. Trader purchases remain separately gated routes, never caps
  on flea values. Mode-scoped manual buy/sell overrides replace the corresponding
  input, including unstable or unavailable flea inputs; zero manual prices remain
  valid. Roubles have unit value one. Browser persistence is unchanged.
- Direct trader purchases are leaf routes from `ItemSummary.buyFromTrader`,
  separate from barter records. Loyalty and task unlocks gate eligibility.
- Crafts and barters may recursively supply ingredients. Batch quantities round
  up; cycle/depth guards bound traversal. Tools are reusable and excluded from
  recurring cost and opportunity-value calculations.
- Preserve both the theoretical cheapest result and the practical recommendation.
  The cheaper eligible direct purchase wins among direct candidates. A recursive
  route must save enough under the engine's threshold (the smaller of 5% of the
  cheapest direct cost or 5,000 roubles) to justify its added steps.
- Zero-input production and quest-only ingredients have unknown cost; they cannot
  act as free recursive sources. Missing pricing remains explicit.
- When unavailable flea inputs leave no usable route or sale source, costs, sale
  values and dependent profit figures remain null. Unstable estimates continue to
  price both recipe inputs and outputs. `sellValueIsEstimate` marks a selected
  unstable flea sale; `sellSourceLabel` names the selected source. Manual sales
  and selected trader sales do not carry the instability warning.
- Output sale text turns yellow with a small warning icon; hover or keyboard
  focus shows **Value unstable** in a compact overlay. There is no row-wide warning.
  Modal recipe summaries use the same selected-sale flag. Sale value, profit and
  profit/hour all use the same estimate, including after ingredient-route changes.
  Route profit and owned-input opportunity value remain distinct. Header totals
  count unpriced rows explicitly; positive value sums priced rows only.
- Hourly profit includes sequential nested craft time allocated per produced item;
  root crafts include their own duration. Instantaneous barter paths have no hourly
  value. Station-aware parallel scheduling and flea fees are not modeled.
- Route profit assumes acquisition of inputs. Owned-input opportunity value compares
  selling the ingredients individually with selling the recipe output; preserve
  that distinction in labels and calculations.

## Availability and UI

Barters and direct trader offers require active-profile loyalty and quest unlocks;
crafts require station level and quest unlocks. `buyLimit` and `restockAmount` are
presentation metadata, not optimizer quantity/live-stock constraints.

[ProfitPageClient](../src/features/profit-pages/ProfitPageClient.tsx) owns filters,
evaluation, selection, and modal navigation. [Components](../src/features/profit-pages/components/)
render sorting, source/availability filters, recipe chains, route alternatives,
price inputs, and recipe previews. The default metric is descending profit/hour.
[useManualPriceOverrides](../src/features/profit-pages/useManualPriceOverrides.ts)
and [usePinnedCrafts](../src/features/profit-pages/usePinnedCrafts.ts) persist
independently by app mode; key and reset semantics belong to [user state](user-state.md).

[ItemDetailRecipeProfit](../src/features/items/item-detail/ItemDetailRecipeProfit.tsx)
uses the same engine with a bounded acquisition tree. Recipe links navigate to
the corresponding profit row; standard ingredient clicks reuse item-modal navigation.
When extending calculations, update the engine and consumers together so a modal
and a full profit page do not disagree for the same inputs.

## Validation

```bash
node --test --import jiti/register src/lib/price-calculation/optimizer.test.ts src/features/profit-pages/utils/recipes.test.ts src/server/queries/page-data-queries.test.ts
```

Include tests for the changed route/availability/pricing rule and browser checks
for affected table sorting, overrides, pins, recipe links, and mode switching.
